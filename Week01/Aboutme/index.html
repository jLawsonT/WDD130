    <p>Hey Everyone! Just a little about me, I am originally from Rexburg Idaho but am 
    currently living in one of my favorite places, Bozeman Montana, for work. I am
    a senior studying physics with a minor in computer science. I am currently figuring out 
    what my next step is, but it most likely will be moving to Utah to start graduate school. 
    Some of my hobbies are biking, snowboarding, skateboarding, photography, reading, and backpacking.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Curch of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my entire life. I served a mission in Montreal 
        Canada, and have loved my time studying at BYU-Idaho. One of my favorite scriptures is 1 Nephi 1:20 - </p>
    <p>“But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, 
        because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.”</p>
    <p>I love this scripture and in my own life I have frequently seen God's hand guiding me, strengthening me, and blessing 
        regardless of my own actions. I know that God is aware of us, and is guiding our lives.
