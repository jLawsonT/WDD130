        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      
        <h3>Goal of Website</h3>
        <p>The goal of the website is to provide a professional portfolio of my engagement and wedding photography, give people information about my pricing, and allow people to get in contact with me. All these things are there to convince my target audience to purchase my photography services.</p>
        
        <h3>Porfolio Goal</h3>
        <p>Probably the most important aspect of the website is providing a portfolio of my work. Ideally I could have one portfolio pages with multiple smaller portfolios of different shoots you can access from there. Everyone likes looking at nice pictures, but I really need to use the best images possible to get a wow reaction.
        </p>

        <h3>Bio Goal</h3>
        <p>Making a connection with my clients is super important, I mean no one really cares if you took nice photos if you were a giant pain to work with, you couldn’t get your clients to pose properly, and they do not like how they looked in any of the photos. That is why my about me is so crucial to make a connection with my clients and seem human.
        </p>

        <h3>Why choose Lawson Photography?
        </h3>
        <p>With 5 years of professional photography experience, and two years of shooting weddings, you can count on me to provide the best possible images with a seamless enjoyable shooting experience. My goal is to create timeless art that you can enjoy and treasure for the rest of your life. I do that through shooting with the most advanced photography equipment available, constantly learning, and constantly improving my skills as a photographer. No matter how nice a photograph is, if you don’t like the way you look it’s not a good picture!

I hope that you enjoy my portfolio because I take a lot of pride in my work.
