                <h2>Why choose Lawson Photography?</h2>
                <p>With 5 years of professional photography experience, and two years of shooting weddings, you can count on me to provide the best possible images with a seamless enjoyable shooting experience. My goal is to create timeless art that you can enjoy and treasure for the rest of your life. I do that through shooting with the most advanced photography equipment available, constantly learning, and constantly improving my skills as a photographer. No matter how nice a photograph is, if you don’t like the way you look it’s not a good picture! I take a lot of time to understand how to pose people, give clear instructions on posing, and have as much fun as possible to capture natural meaningful interactions. I hope that you enjoy my portfolio because I take a lot of pride in my work.

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Lawson Turcotte. I am originally from Rexburg Idaho but am currently living in Logan. Photography has been a hobby of mine since I was a teenager, and have shot professionally for 5 years, and have two years of wedding experience. When I’m not taking pictures some other hobbies that I enjoy are cycling, backpacking, snowboarding, skateboarding, and reading. I come from a family of 6 kids, and love to spend my time with them! I also have an absolutely incredible fiancee named Ellie.</p>
